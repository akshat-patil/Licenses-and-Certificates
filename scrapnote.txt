ðŸ‘‰ Suggestion:

In your Excel file, create 3 sheets with names: Workflow, Authorization Matrix, and Department Roles.

Copy-paste the tables above into their respective sheets.


Would you like me to also prepare a Sheet 4: Notifications & Triggers (who receives email alerts at each step)? That can make your Excel documentation even more complete.
